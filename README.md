Open Ray and it shows your net worth, spending vs last month, budget pacing, and upcoming bills — before you type a word. Ask a question and it answers from your real data, not guesses. Local-first. Encrypted. Open source.

## Features

- **It already knows** — Every conversation starts with a real-time financial briefing. Net worth, spending velocity, budget alerts, goal pace, upcoming bills, and your daily score. No "let me look that up."
- **Persistent context** — Ray maintains a financial profile that evolves with you: income, goals, strategy, key decisions, and open items. It updates this context as your situation changes, so every conversation picks up where the last one left off.
- **Long-term memory** — Important details from conversations are saved as memories. Mention you're saving for a house or switching jobs and Ray remembers — without you repeating yourself.
- **Bank sync via Plaid** — Connect checking, savings, credit cards, investments, and loans
- **Encrypted local database** — All data stays on your machine in an AES-256 encrypted SQLite database
- **Daily scoring** — A 0-100 behavior score with streaks and 14 unlockable achievements. No restaurants for a week? That's Kitchen Hero. Five zero-spend days? Monk Mode.
- **CFO personality** — Ray doesn't list options. It tells you what it would do and why, references your goals, and flags problems you haven't noticed yet.
- **Budgets and goals** — Track spending limits by category and progress toward financial goals
- **PII masking** — Names, account numbers, and identifying details are scrubbed before anything reaches the AI. Your data is analyzed, not exposed.
- **Smart alerts** — Large transactions, low balances, budget overruns
- **Auto-recategorization** — Define rules to automatically re-label transactions
- **Scheduled daily sync** — Automatic bank sync via launchd (macOS) or cron (Linux)
- **Export/import** — Back up and restore your financial data

## Install

```bash
npm install -g ray-finance
```

## Try It

Explore Ray with realistic fake data — no bank accounts needed.

```bash
ray demo                # seed a demo database
ray --demo status       # financial overview
ray --demo accounts     # linked accounts with balances
ray --demo spending     # spending breakdown by category
ray --demo budgets      # budget tracking
ray --demo goals        # financial goal progress
ray --demo score        # daily score, streaks, achievements
ray --demo alerts       # financial alerts
ray --demo transactions # recent transactions
```

The dashboard commands work with no setup at all. To also try the AI chat with demo data, run `ray setup` first and add an [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com) or Ray API key — then `ray --demo` will start an interactive session where you can ask questions about the fake portfolio.

When you're ready to connect real accounts, run `ray link`.

## Quick Start

```bash
ray setup
```

The setup wizard offers two modes:

### Quick setup (managed)

We handle the API keys. Your data stays local. $10/mo.

1. Enter your name
2. Get a Ray API key (opens Stripe checkout)
3. Link your accounts — checking, savings, credit cards, investments, loans, mortgage
4. Done — daily sync auto-scheduled at 6am

### Self-hosted

Bring your own Anthropic and Plaid credentials. Free forever.

1. Enter your Anthropic API key ([get one](https://console.anthropic.com))
2. Enter your Plaid credentials ([get free keys](https://dashboard.plaid.com/signup))
3. Link your accounts — checking, savings, credit cards, investments, loans, mortgage
4. Done

## How It Works

```
  Checking · Savings · Credit · Investments · Loans · Mortgage
                            │
                        Plaid API

                      Claude API
                     (PII-masked)
```

Two outbound calls: Plaid (bank sync) and Anthropic (AI chat, PII-masked). Your financial data is never stored off your machine. No telemetry. No analytics.

## Security & Privacy

- All financial data stored locally in `~/.ray/data/finance.db`
- Database encrypted with AES-256 (SQLCipher)
- Plaid access tokens encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM
- Config file stored with `0600` permissions
- PII redacted before sending to Claude API
- No data leaves your machine — only API calls to Plaid and Anthropic

## Configuration

Ray stores everything in `~/.ray/`:

```
~/.ray/
  config.json          # API keys and preferences (0600 permissions)
  context.md           # Persistent financial context for AI
  data/
    finance.db         # Encrypted SQLite database
    demo.db            # Demo database (created by `ray demo`)
  sync.log             # Daily sync output
```

### Environment Variables

You can also configure Ray via environment variables or a `.env` file:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=     # Anthropic API key for AI chat
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=       # Plaid client ID
PLAID_SECRET=          # Plaid secret key
PLAID_ENV=production   # Plaid environment
DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY=     # Database encryption key
PLAID_TOKEN_SECRET=    # Key for encrypting stored Plaid tokens
RAY_API_KEY=           # Ray API key (managed mode, replaces the above)
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Bring your own model — use any LLM provider (OpenAI, Ollama, open-source models, etc.)
- [ ] Daily digest email — morning summary of your finances
