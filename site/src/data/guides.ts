When you use Monarch, Copilot, or YNAB, your transaction history lives on their infrastructure — subject to their security practices, their privacy policies, and their business decisions. If they get hacked, your data is exposed. If they shut down, your data may be lost.",

With cloud apps, it goes to their servers.",
